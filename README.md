# text-to-audio-PYTHON-
Text-to-audio conversion is a process that transforms written text into spoken words. This can be achieved using various libraries and tools available in Python. One of the popular libraries for this purpose is gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech). The gTTS library provides an easy-to-use interface to convert text into speech using Google's Text-to-Speech API.

Overview

1)Library Imports:
gtts is imported as gt to facilitate text-to-speech conversion.
os is imported to interact with the operating system, particularly to play the generated audio file.

2)Text Input:
The user is prompted to enter the text that they want to convert into speech.

3)Text-to-Speech Conversion:
The gTTS class from the gtts library is used to convert the input text into speech. The language is set to English (lang="en").

4)Saving the Audio File:
The generated speech is saved as an MP3 file named "english-audio.mp3".

5)Playing the Audio File:
The os.system function is used to play the saved MP3 file using the system's default media player.
